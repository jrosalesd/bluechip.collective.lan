            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>How long will it take for me to know if I am approved?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">When you apply on our website, by the end of the application you will be informed if you have been approved.</p>

            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>When will the money be deposited in my account?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">It typically takes about 1 business day.</p>

            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>Are there any penalties/fees for paying the loan off early?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">NO, there are no penalties and you can pay off the loan at any time. This would also save you money in interest!
            <br>If a customer states they are planning on paying off their loan within 30 days of receiving it, suggest to them we may not be the least expensive option. Some payday loans are less expensive if they truly can pay it off in two weeks.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">Let them know that you want to be sure they are aware of all of their options before moving forward. Listen to the customer and try to figure out what their needs are and what information you can give them that would help them.</p>

            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>Can I check my account online?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">Yes, you are able to access your loan balance, next payment date and amount online at account.spotloan.com. If you have questions about the information, please call 1-888-681-6811 to speak with the first available Relationship Manager.</p>

            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>What counts as a steady form of income?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly income from a job, social security, disability, retirement, pension, etc. We do NOT accept child support or settlement as a primary source of income.</p>

            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>Do I have to have a checking account?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">No. We have the capability to direct deposit and withdraw funds into checking OR savings accounts.
            <br>We do not accept pre-paid debit cards for loan deposits but we are able to take payments from these if the borrower calls in to make payments or pays online.
            </p>
            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>Do I have to have an email address?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">Yes. If you do not have an email address, we won?t be able to send you the loan acceptance email and the loan will not be deposited into your account. We communicate primarily through email so it?s extremely important you have an email account that you check on a regular basis. (Do not walk a potential borrower through an email set up process).</p>

            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>Can I make weekly payments?</b></font></h4>
            <ul style="text-indent:20px;">
                <li><p>Unfortunately no. We offer bi-weekly, semi-monthly or once a month payments. However, we do offer other ways of making extra payments should you chose to do so.
                    <br>If asked for more details express that we do take payments with debit/credit/prepaid debit cards.</p></li>
                <li><p>We do not offer recurring card payments. They must actively notify us when they would like to make a card payment by calling or making the payment online.</p></li>
                <li><p>We accept MasterCard, Visa, and Discover. We also accept personal checks, cashier?s checks and money orders.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>Do I have to make payments out of my bank account?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">We encourage you to make payments this way as we find it works for most people because they do not have to remember to mail in a payment. It is perfectly acceptable to decline auto-debit of your bank account.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">If you choose not to make payments via your bank account please be sure to mail in your payments with enough time for them to arrive on or before your payment due date or be sure to call in or log on the website to make your payment on the day it is due.</p>

            <h4><font color="#F09646"><b>Are there any incentives for repeat borrowers or referrals?</b></font></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:20px;">Yes, we offer our repeat borrowers a lower interest rate! We want to thank them for coming back and working with us again. We greatly appreciate their business. We do not offer incentives for referrals.</p>
